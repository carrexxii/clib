# Clibanarii

(Clib)anarii is my personal collection of C utilities and conventions. They are not currently optimized,
but should be very easy to understand and use. It will continuously evolve over time as I need new components,
optimizations, etc.

### Current Working Components
- Variable/resizing array (VArray)
- Bucket arr (BArray)
- Arena allocator (Arena)
- Binary heap (MinHeap)
- Queue (Queue)
- Hash table (HTable)
- Strings (C string, String and StringBuilder)

### TODO
- Proper tests
- Hash table improvements
- Memory allocators
- MaxHeap/generalize the binary heap
- String types for long text
